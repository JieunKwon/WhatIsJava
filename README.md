#  What is Java

  -  Describe and define about Java

> 1. What is Java?
  - Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of         platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.
  
> 2. Java features 
  - Object Oriented, Platform Independent, Robust, Interpreted, and Multi-threaded
 
> 3. Object
  - Object is a runtime entity and itâ€™s state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods. Methods operate on an object's          internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.

> 4. Class 
  - is a blue print from which individual objects are created. 
   A class can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object.

> 5. Steps for creating an Object for a class?
  - An Object is first declared
  - instantiated
  - initialized

> 6. Inheritance
  - It is the process where one object acquires the properties of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made        manageable in a hierarchical order. 

> 7. Polymorphism 
  - the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
   The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

> 8. Abstraction
  - It refers to the ability to make a class abstract in OOP. 
  It helps to reduce the complexity and also improves the maintainability of the system.

> 9. Encapsulation
  - It is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods. 
  If a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class.           Therefore encapsulation is also referred to as data hiding.
  
  - The primary benefit of Encapsulation is the ability to modify our implemented code without breaking the code of others who use our      code. With this Encapsulation gives maintainability, flexibility and extensibility to our code.

> 10. Interface
  - a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.

> 12. Packages
  - A Package can be defined as a grouping of related types(classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations ) providing access protection and name space management.
